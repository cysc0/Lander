# APP

## What is it
This project is a game much like [moonlander](http://moonlander.seb.ly/)  
In the game itself, the goal is to ...  
Our app maintains tables w/in the database for users, courses, and user's game history. The courses are generated by users, allowing them to pick 2 points on a map, and the app then generates elevation data (interpolating ~200 points between those chosen points), and the terrain is build using that data.

## Requirements
**More ambitious than previous assignments:** our application incorporates all elements from previous SPA assignments, including authenticated user sessions, inter-relational DB tables, and channels/topics for user games. It also incorporates 2 authenticated API's (google maps and google elevation). The game is also significantly more complicated than previous, as it handles game logic on the server, and represents the game state to the user via the react konva library.  
**Server side is Elixir/Phoenix:** yes  
**Significant back-end logic:** The non-game logic is as complicated as previous assignments, as it uses authenticated sessions, SPA setup, and AJAX requests for most server<->client interaction. Aside from the maps API implementation (and essential front-end logic), everything is handled in the back-end (including game logic, elevation API, database interaction, ...)  
**Deployed on our VPS:** the application is hosted on one of our VPS's  
**User accounts:** our application enables signups/logins using secured/hashed passwords  
**External API:** We use 2 API's. While the maps API implementation is client<->API, the elevation API meets the requirement of server<-> server. Both API's are authenticated.  
**Phoenix channels:** Our application uses phoenix channels for the game state.  
**Team size:** Our team consists of 2 members.
